# Custom Webhooks
    
Having trouble adding webhooks? No problem! Here's some ways you can get those webhooks sorted out. 

## Currently Supported Actions
    
While all actions can send webhooks, not all will send body data. Here's the list of webhooks that currently are supported:
    
* **publish_[post-type]**: this one fires when a post is published. Use the post type's slug to determine for what post type the webhook is fired for (i.e. "publish_post" for posts)
